oauth2l ("OAuth 2.0 Utility") is a command-line tool developed by Google
to simplify the process of obtaining and using OAuth 2.0 access tokens.
It supports a range of flows including three-legged authorization with
PKCE and loopback redirect, making it suitable for desktop and server
environments. oauth2l is especially useful for authenticating to
Google APIs without requiring a browser on the target system.
Tokens can be output directly or used to authorize API calls.
